# Monitor

The `monitor` block in the box's Caddyfile tells you when something on
the box goes wrong: an app stuck restarting, a deploy that failed or
was refused, a rollback, a backup gone stale, a certificate that did not
renew, a disk filling up. motel spots each of these and hands it to
Debian's Alertmanager, which sends it to your channels: ntfy, Slack,
Discord, or any URL that takes Alertmanager's JSON. The block's
`metrics` line also keeps the box's numbers and each app's in Debian's
VictoriaMetrics for 14 days, and its `rule` lines alert on those
numbers. This page is how to set it up, check that it works, add your
own events, read what it sends, look at the numbers, and turn it off
again. How it works, and everything it refuses, is in
[notify/DESIGN-notify.md](../notify/DESIGN-notify.md) and
[notify/DESIGN-metrics.md](../notify/DESIGN-metrics.md).

**Experimental.** Monitor is on the `feature/notify-and-metrics` branch
and in no release yet. Its block, its commands and the files it writes
may change before it ships.

The transcripts below come from motel's metrics e2e box at commit
01b2fd5 (Debian 13, with `prometheus-alertmanager` 0.28.1 and
`victoria-metrics` 1.112.0 from Debian). Its channels were a stub
receiver on the compose network over plain HTTP, which only the test
rig's `allow_insecure_channels` line allows, and the example blocks
here were validated with https values. Nothing on this page has been
tried against real Slack or Discord. A real ntfy topic and a reboot
with monitor set up were tried only on another box, at an earlier
commit.
[The last section](#what-has-been-verified-where) says what was
checked where.

## What it runs

| Piece | What it is | Listens on |
|---|---|---|
| motel | spots the events, and writes a `monitor: event` line to the journal for each one before delivering it | its admin socket, `/run/motel/admin.sock` |
| Alertmanager | Debian's `prometheus-alertmanager`. It routes and sends, using a config motel writes from the block | `/run/motel-notify/am.sock` only (0660 root:motel) |
| the store (with `metrics`) | Debian's `victoria-metrics`: the numbers, kept 14 days, and vmalert, which checks the rules motel writes | `/run/motel-metrics/vm.sock` only (0660 root:motel). Its TCP stays inside a network namespace of its own, `motel-metrics` |

Neither Alertmanager nor the store opens a TCP port on the box, and
neither ships a web UI.
Debian's Alertmanager page at `/` says "The Debian package of the
alertmanager does not include a web application", and the store's
`/vmui/` answers `404 page not found`. You look at things with `curl`
over the sockets and with `amtool` ([Look at the
numbers](#look-at-the-numbers)).

## Who runs these

Setup, every `systemctl` line, and edits under `/etc/motel` and
`/etc/systemd` are root's: run them over SSH as root
(`ssh root@box.example.com`), or with `sudo` in front if your
administrator's `sudo` is root's. `motel monitor send` and
`motel monitor test` talk to motel's admin socket, which root and the
`motel` user can reach and no app can. The journal is readable by the
`adm` group.

## Set it up

As root on the box:

```sh
# 1. Debian's Alertmanager and, with --metrics, its VictoriaMetrics.
#    Each unit is masked before its package installs, so nothing ever
#    listens on Debian's ports (9093, 9094, 8428). Leave out --metrics
#    to get notifications only.
motel monitor setup --metrics
# 2. Each channel's URL goes in the box's own secrets file, root:motel 0640.
#    With a box repo (examples/box), run on your machine
#        make secret APP=_box VAR=NOTIFY_OPS_URL
#    and push it with step 3: the box writes the file. Without one,
#    make the file (once: install empties a file that is there) and add
#    a line per URL:
install -m 0640 -o root -g motel /dev/null /etc/motel/secrets/_box.env
printf '%s\n' 'NOTIFY_OPS_URL=https://ntfy.sh/<a topic of your own>' >>/etc/motel/secrets/_box.env
# 3. The monitor block, in the Caddyfile's global options (below). With
#    a box repo, commit and push it: the box validates it and reloads
#    motel itself, so skip step 4. Without one, edit /etc/motel/Caddyfile.
# 4. Check it, then load it:
motel validate --config /etc/motel/Caddyfile
systemctl reload motel
# 5. Send one test notification to each channel:
motel monitor test ops
```

The smallest block, with one channel and the numbers:

```
{
	admin unix//run/motel/admin.sock

	liveswap {
		…
	}

	monitor {
		channel ops ntfy {secret.NOTIFY_OPS_URL}
		operator ops
		metrics
	}
}
```

The box-repo path needs this branch's `examples/box` tooling in the
repository, since no release has monitor yet. A repository made from a
released template refuses `APP=_box` (`app '_box': lower-case letters,
digits and - only`). Its `check` job validates with the latest release
unless `MOTEL_VERSION` names another, and no release knows the block,
so every commit that has it fails that job with `unrecognized global
option: monitor`. The push still reaches the box, which checks it with
its own motel.

On a box with nothing installed yet, setup says:

```
$ motel monitor setup --metrics
masked prometheus-alertmanager.service, so the install starts nothing
installed prometheus-alertmanager
wrote /etc/systemd/system/prometheus-alertmanager.service.d/10-motel.conf
wrote /etc/systemd/system/motel-am.socket
wrote /var/lib/motel-notify/alertmanager.yml, a config that sends nothing, until motel renders the monitor block's channels
Alertmanager listens on /run/motel-notify/am.sock only, started by its first connection
reloaded motel, whose config has no monitor block with channels: Alertmanager sends nothing until there is one (docs/monitor.md); add it, then systemctl reload motel
masked victoria-metrics.service, so the install starts nothing
iproute2 is installed
installed victoria-metrics
wrote /etc/systemd/system/victoria-metrics.service.d/10-motel.conf
wrote /etc/systemd/system/motel-metrics-netns.service
wrote /etc/systemd/system/motel-vm.socket
wrote /etc/systemd/system/motel-vm.service
wrote /etc/systemd/system/motel-am-metrics.socket
wrote /etc/systemd/system/prometheus-alertmanager.service.d/20-motel-metrics.conf
wrote /etc/systemd/system/motel-vmalert.service
wrote /var/lib/motel-metrics/scrape.yml
wrote /var/lib/motel-metrics/rules.yml
started Alertmanager, once, so that it listens in the namespace (motel-am-metrics.socket) beside its unix socket
the store listens on /run/motel-metrics/vm.sock only, its TCP in the motel-metrics namespace
reloaded motel, whose config has no monitor block with a metrics line: nothing is pushed until there is one (docs/monitor.md); add it, then systemctl reload motel
```

The two `reloaded motel` lines say what the loaded config does with
what setup made: here it has no monitor block yet, so nothing is
rendered and nothing is pushed until step 4 loads one. With the block
loaded, they say `which renders the monitor block's channels into …`
and `which renders the store's rules into … and pushes`. Run again later, setup puts
its units back as the binary ships them. `motel monitor setup` (without
`--metrics`) restarts Alertmanager, which forgets the alerts it holds,
so run it at a quiet moment. `--metrics` on a box where Alertmanager is
already set up redoes only the store. The first time, and after an
upgrade from a build whose store reached Alertmanager through a proxy
(setup says `retired motel-am-proxy.socket …`), it restarts
Alertmanager once (`started`, here, where nothing had started it yet), so that Alertmanager holds its own listener in the
store's namespace; later runs leave it running.

Each test answers within about 15 seconds:

```
$ motel monitor test ops
delivered to ops
$ motel monitor test oncall
Error: oncall: Alertmanager could not deliver (discord: other); journalctl -u prometheus-alertmanager says more
```

It exits 1 unless the message was delivered, and it never prints the
URL. A test goes to its channel whatever that channel's `severity`
floor is.

### The secrets file

`/etc/motel/secrets/_box.env` holds one `NOTIFY_<NAME>=<url>` line per
URL. The block names each value as `{secret.NOTIFY_<NAME>}`, because a
Slack or Discord hook URL works as a password by itself and the
Caddyfile is not secret. motel reads the file and no app is given it.
It must be **root:motel 0640**. A file made elsewhere and moved in with
`mv` keeps its owner, group and mode: one made in `/root` with
`install -m 600`, or by an editor under umask 077, is root:root 0600.
One made in place gets the directory's group, motel, but keeps its
mode, and 0600 shuts motel out all the same. `validate`, run as root,
refuses such a file, though root can read it:

```
$ ls -l /etc/motel/secrets/_box.env
-rw------- 1 root root 269 Nov 12 17:46 /etc/motel/secrets/_box.env
$ motel validate --config /etc/motel/Caddyfile
… monitor: the motel user cannot read the box's secrets file /etc/motel/secrets/_box.env (root:root 0600): a reload would be refused and a restart would drop every channel; chown root:motel /etc/motel/secrets/_box.env && chmod 0640 /etc/motel/secrets/_box.env
```

A reload is refused too, and the journal says why (`monitor: reading
the box's secrets: open /etc/motel/secrets/_box.env: permission
denied`). A restart or a reboot loads the config without a single
channel, and the journal says so with `monitor: the box's secrets file
cannot be used: every channel that reads a secret is dropped from this
load` and `monitor: no operator channel is left in this load: box
events are journal lines only`. Fix it with:

```sh
chown root:motel /etc/motel/secrets/_box.env && chmod 0640 /etc/motel/secrets/_box.env
systemctl reload motel
```

`motel reload --config /etc/motel/Caddyfile` does the same: with a
monitor block in the file it loads it even when the Caddyfile has not
changed, as `systemctl reload` does, since the block reads
`_box.env`, which the Caddyfile does not hold.

A key that is missing is refused by `validate` and by a reload, and so
is one set to nothing (`NOTIFY_OPS_URL=`):

```
monitor: channel phone: secret NOTIFY_PHONE_URL is not in the box's secrets (/etc/motel/secrets/_box.env)
monitor: channel ops: secret NOTIFY_OPS_URL is empty in the box's secrets (/etc/motel/secrets/_box.env): give it the channel's URL
```

`motel monitor test <channel>` on a channel a boot dropped says so
(`channel phone was dropped from this load: its secret could not be
used …`) and names the mend.

### The block's lines

```
monitor {
	channel <name> json|ntfy|slack|discord {secret.NOTIFY_<NAME>} [severity critical|warning|info]
	operator <channel>...           # who hears every event: the box's, and every app's
	bind <identity> <channel>       # an app's deployer: hears the events of the apps that trust the identity
	heartbeat {secret.NOTIFY_<NAME>} # a dead-man check's ping URL (below)
	deploy_succeeded on             # off by default
	metrics                         # keep the numbers (needs setup --metrics)
	rule <name> …                   # your alerts on the numbers (needs metrics)
}
```

- **`channel`**: `severity warning` means a channel hears warnings and
  criticals but no info. A URL has to be https, to a public address and
  host name; anything else is refused by name.
- **`operator`**: required. It names the channels that hear everything.
- **`bind`**: `<identity>` starts as a deploy's `deployed_by` does in
  `GET /<app>`, and is not written as the `deploy_trust` block:
  `local:/etc/motel/alice.pub`, or
  `"oidc:<issuer> repository=<org>/<repo>"`, quoted because an oidc
  identity always carries a claim after a space. Give only claims the
  app's `deploy_trust` pins. `deployed_by` also shows what the token
  carried (`ref=…`, `actor=…`, `sub=…`), and a bind with one of those
  is refused unless the block pins it. A bind to an identity that no
  app trusts is refused in the same words (`no app's deploy_trust
  trusts this identity`), so revoking a key also means removing its
  bind.
- **`heartbeat`**: without it, every load warns `monitor: no heartbeat
  in this load: nothing outside the box hears that it, motel or
  Alertmanager stopped`.

Every line, and the less common ones (`secrets_file`,
`backup_record`), is in DESIGN-notify.md's [The monitor
block](../notify/DESIGN-notify.md#the-monitor-block). Alertmanager's
paths are not lines: its state directory is fixed at
`/var/lib/motel-notify` and its socket at `/run/motel-notify/am.sock`,
the ones setup makes.

## A heartbeat: hear that the box stopped

Nothing on a box can report that the box itself is down. A dead-man
check off the box can: it expects a ping on a schedule and alerts you
when one is missed. motel pings it every five minutes for as long as
motel and Alertmanager both run. A restart of motel, or a reload that
changes Alertmanager's config, starts the five minutes again, so the
ping after one can come later: 7 minutes 20 seconds after the last was
measured, and about nine is the most. The Grace below covers it.

1. Make a check at [Healthchecks](https://healthchecks.io) (or another
   service that takes a plain ping URL) with **Period 5 minutes** and a
   Grace of 10 minutes. It then reports the box down about 15 minutes
   after the last ping.
2. Put its ping URL in the secrets file as `NOTIFY_HC_URL`, and add the
   line `heartbeat {secret.NOTIFY_HC_URL}` to the block. With a box
   repo, do both there (`make secret APP=_box VAR=NOTIFY_HC_URL`, and
   the line in the repository's Caddyfile) and push: a line or a secret
   edited in on the box is gone at the next push, which replaces both
   files.
3. Without a box repo, `motel validate --config /etc/motel/Caddyfile`,
   then `systemctl reload motel`. The first ping goes out within the
   minute.

The ping is Alertmanager's JSON for an alert named `Watchdog`, POSTed
to the URL: `"summary":"motel is running and can reach Alertmanager"`.
Healthchecks treats any request to the URL as a ping. **Pause the check
before you stop motel or Alertmanager on purpose**, or it will page you.

## Uptime: hear that a site stopped answering

The heartbeat tells you motel runs. It does not tell you that a site
answers its visitors. For that, use an external uptime monitor (a
keyword check) against each site: it fetches a page and looks for a
word that only the app's own page contains, so an error page reads as
down. A cached copy would still read as up, so check a page the cache
does not hold, such as the app's health path if the site routes it to
the app. penaltybox does not box such a monitor by default: it counts
only responses an app labels level 2 or 3, and an ordinary page is
level 1 ([penaltybox](../penaltybox/README.md#the-wire-contract)). A
site set to `min_level 1` counts every response, the monitor's too, so
check a path that site does not penalise.

## Your own events: `motel monitor send`

Anything that can run a command can send an event: cron, a systemd
unit, a script. `motel monitor send` posts it over the admin socket.
Each event becomes a `monitor: event` line in the journal and goes to
the operator's channels (with `--subject app:<name>`, to that app's
deployers too). Two things keep an event from a channel. A channel
with a `severity` floor hears nothing below it, and an event is a
warning unless `--severity` says otherwise. And one key (the source,
subject, name and instance together) sends four messages at once, then
one more every 15 minutes: past that, an event is a journal line only,
marked `"suppressed":"more than four an hour for this key"`.

An event is either a one-shot (the default) or, with `--state firing`,
a state that holds until a `--state resolved` with the same `--source`,
`--subject`, `--name` and `--instance`. A `resolved` that differs in
any of the four, or one sent when nothing is firing, does nothing, and
answers `resolved nothing: no state fires under <key> …` (exit 0, so a
producer may resolve whatever it last said). On a box where
`motel monitor setup` has not run, `send` exits 1 with `journalled as
<key>, and delivered nowhere: …`. `--summary` is always needed: one line, at
most 200 characters. When a state resolves, the message repeats the
summary it fired with, not the one you give.

**A state does not outlive a restart of motel** (an upgrade of the
package restarts it). motel forgets the state, and five minutes later
Alertmanager tells your channels it is `[RESOLVED]`, although nothing
recovered. So a producer of a state sends `--state firing` again every
two or three minutes for as long as the condition holds (a repeat while the
state is firing sends no second message), or sends one-shots instead.

The names motel uses itself are refused:

```
$ motel monitor send --source reboot --name watchdog_x --summary x
Error: watchdog_x is one of motel's own events; name yours something else
```

### A reboot that waits

Debian's unattended upgrades leave `/run/reboot-required` when an update
needs a reboot ([Hardening](hardening.md)), and never reboot by
themselves. This timer reminds you once a day for as long as the file
is there. A reboot both clears the file and empties the memory of
motel and Alertmanager, so the reminder is a one-shot: a state would
never get its recovery.

`/etc/systemd/system/motel-reboot-required.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Tell the operator a reboot waits (motel monitor send)
ConditionPathExists=/run/reboot-required

[Service]
Type=oneshot
Environment=HOME=/root
ExecStart=/usr/bin/motel monitor send --source reboot --name reboot_required --summary "a reboot waits: an update needs it (cat /run/reboot-required.pkgs)"
```

`/etc/systemd/system/motel-reboot-required.timer`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Once a day, tell the operator a reboot waits

[Timer]
OnCalendar=09:00
Persistent=true

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

```sh
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable --now motel-reboot-required.timer
systemctl start motel-reboot-required.service   # once now: sends only if a reboot waits
```

With no reboot waiting, the run does nothing (`systemctl status` says
`ConditionPathExists=/run/reboot-required was not met`). With one
waiting, its journal says `sent external:reboot/box/reboot_required`.
`Environment=HOME=/root` stops motel from warning that it cannot find
its config directory each time.

### A unit that failed: `OnFailure=`

To hear about a job of your own failing (a nightly report, an import),
write one template unit and point the job's `OnFailure=` at it.
`/etc/systemd/system/motel-send-failed@.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Tell the operator that %i failed (motel monitor send)

[Service]
Type=oneshot
Environment=HOME=/root
ExecStart=/usr/bin/motel monitor send --source systemd --name unit_failed --instance %i --summary "%i failed: see journalctl -u %i"
```

`--instance` takes at most 128 letters, digits and `._:/@-`, and the
summary at most 200 characters, so a unit name over about 90
characters, or one with an escape in it (a template instance such as
`srv\x2ddata`), is refused (`Error: instance is at most 128 letters,
digits and ._:/@-`). The notifier unit then fails, and no channel
hears that the job failed: name the units you point here plainly.

Then, in the job's unit (or in a drop-in made with
`systemctl edit nightly-report.service`):

```ini
[Unit]
OnFailure=motel-send-failed@%n.service
```

After `systemctl daemon-reload`, a failing `nightly-report.service`
reaches the operator's channels as `[FIRING] unit_failed`, with the
summary naming the unit. It is a warning, so a channel whose floor is
`severity critical` does not hear it, and a unit that fails more often
than the four-then-one-a-quarter-hour above is a journal line only for
the rest. motel already reports its own failures (backups and the
drill among them), so there is no need to point `motel-backup.service`
at this.

## Read what it sends

### In the journal

Every event is written to motel's journal before it is delivered, so the
journal is the record even when a channel is down. These two are from
a test of `--state firing`, then `--state resolved` (the reboot
recipe's one-shot says `"state":"oneshot"`):

```
$ journalctl -u motel -o cat | grep '"monitor: event"'
{"level":"info","ts":1794506376.5473716,"logger":"monitor","msg":"monitor: event","key":"external:reboot/box/reboot_required","state":"firing","severity":"warning","summary":"a kernel update waits for a reboot","source":"external:reboot"}
{"level":"info","ts":1794506464.4814832,"logger":"monitor","msg":"monitor: event","key":"external:reboot/box/reboot_required","state":"resolved","severity":"warning","summary":"a kernel update waits for a reboot","source":"external:reboot"}
```

`state` is `firing`, `resolved` or `oneshot`. The `key` says what the
event is about: `<source>/<subject>/<name>[/<instance>]`. Other lines
start the same way, with `monitor:` or `monitor metrics:` (a warning
or an error says what to do). If the block was loaded before setup ran,
you will see
`monitor: Alertmanager is not set up on this box (run motel monitor setup as root); events are journal lines only until it is`,
and `motel validate` and `motel reload` say it too, as a `WARNING:`
line. They also warn when the units a setup wrote (or the store's `scrape.yml`) differ from the ones
this motel would write (after an upgrade that changed them), and name
the setup to run again.
When Alertmanager cannot deliver, `journalctl -u prometheus-alertmanager`
gives its reason, with the receiver and the channel's kind but never
the URL:

```
time=2026-11-12T17:45:33.575Z level=ERROR source=dispatch.go:360 msg="Notify for alerts failed" component=dispatcher num_alerts=1 err="state-disk-box-warning/discord[0]: notify retry canceled due to unrecoverable error after 1 attempts: unexpected status code 400"
```

motel reads Alertmanager's failure counters, and tells the operator's
other channels about a failure as `ChannelFailed` (DESIGN-notify.md,
"Failed delivery"). `ChannelFailed` is a warning, so a channel with
`severity critical` never hears it. That goes wrong in two cases.
With a single operator channel there is no other channel to tell, and
the heartbeat goes on pinging, so nothing off the box hears it either. And
two channels of one integration count as one, so a failure points at
both as suspects, and neither hears it: ntfy and json are both
Alertmanager's webhook integration. Give the operator two channels of
different integrations, such as ntfy and Slack, and let one of them
take warnings. ntfy with json is one integration.

A state is told twice: once when it fires (after 30 seconds, so a burst
arrives as one message) and once when it resolves. While it holds, a
reminder comes every 4 hours (every 24 for a disk). The events motel
reports itself, and when each resolves, are in DESIGN-notify.md's
[Events](../notify/DESIGN-notify.md#events) table.

### What each channel kind shows

Here is what each kind received for a firing `disk_low` and its
recovery (from the stub receiver; a real app's rendering is
untested):

| Kind | What is posted | Firing | Resolved |
|---|---|---|---|
| `json` | Alertmanager's webhook JSON as it is: `status`, `receiver`, and for each alert its `labels` (`alertname`, `severity`, `key`, `app` or `instance`) and `annotations.summary` | `"status":"firing"` | `"status":"resolved"` |
| `ntfy` | the same JSON, POSTed to the topic URL with no title. ntfy shows the JSON text itself as the message. A critical is sent at ntfy's priority 5 (urgent) and a warning at 4 (high), as an `X-Priority` header, `ChannelFailed` and `motel monitor test` at 4 too; info at the default | — | — (a recovery has its alert's priority: the header is fixed per severity) |
| `slack` | an attachment: title `[FIRING] disk_low` (with the app's name after it for an app event), text the summary, one line per alert; no title link, and the title as the fallback text | colour by severity: `danger` (red) for a critical, `warning` (yellow) for a warning, blue for info | title and each line prefixed `[RESOLVED]`, colour `good` |
| `discord` | an embed: the same title, the summary as its description | colour 10038562 (dark red), whatever the severity: Alertmanager 0.28 has no setting for it | `[RESOLVED]`, colour 3066993 (green) |

## Look at the numbers

With the `metrics` line, motel pushes every 30 seconds. The store keeps
each series for 14 days. There is no dashboard. You read the numbers in
three ways.

### `GET /<app>`, as a deployer

The deploy status that `GET /<app>` returns (with the deploy token, as
a deploy uses it: [liveswap/README.md](../liveswap/README.md)) gains a
`metrics` object over the last hour, or over the day with `?range=24h`:

```json
"metrics":{"window":"1h","at":"2026-11-12T17:50:00Z","memory_bytes":{"now":2830336,"max":2830336},"cpu_cores":{"avg_5m":0.003289,"avg":0.003289},"requests":{"total":41,"per_second":0.011389,"by_class":{"2xx":40,"4xx":1},"5xx_share":0,"p50_ms":2.5,"p95_ms":4.8,"cache_hit_share":0.975}}
```

Any other range is refused: `{"error":"range must be one of 1h, 24h"}`
(HTTP 422). `requests` appears only for an app whose site has
`observe <app>` in front of it ([liveswap/README.md](../liveswap/README.md)).
`memory_max_bytes` appears only for an app with a memory cap. A number
with nothing behind it in the window is left out.

### PromQL over the socket, as root

The store answers Prometheus's query API on its socket:

```sh
curl -s --unix-socket /run/motel-metrics/vm.sock -G \
  --data-urlencode 'query=motel_app_up' http://vm/api/v1/query
```

```
{"status":"success","data":{"resultType":"vector","result":[{"metric":{"__name__":"motel_app_up","app":"blog","job":"motel"},"value":[1794505816,"1"]},{"metric":{"__name__":"motel_app_up","app":"shop","job":"motel"},"value":[1794505816,"0"]}]},…}
```

The series motel pushes are `motel_app_up`, `motel_app_release_info`,
`motel_app_memory_bytes` (and `motel_app_memory_max_bytes` for a capped
app), `motel_app_cpu_seconds_total`, `motel_app_observed` (an app
with `observe`), `motel_app_requests_total` (by `class`, with
`observe`), `motel_app_response_seconds` (a histogram),
`motel_app_cache_responses_total`, `motel_disk_avail_bytes`,
`motel_metrics_push_failed_total` and `motel_notify_delivery_failed_total`,
along with Caddy's own `go_*`, `process_*` and `caddy_*`. To list what
is there:

```sh
curl -s --unix-socket /run/motel-metrics/vm.sock -G \
  --data-urlencode 'match[]={job="motel"}' http://vm/api/v1/label/__name__/values
```

`query_range` (`/api/v1/query_range` with `start`, `end` and `step`)
works the same way. What each series means is in DESIGN-metrics.md's
[What motel pushes](../notify/DESIGN-metrics.md#what-motel-pushes).

The store also scrapes itself, vmalert and Alertmanager, and keeps
only the series motel reads (`/var/lib/motel-metrics/scrape.yml`):
`vm_free_disk_space_bytes`, which the store's disk rule reads,
`alertmanager_notifications_failed_total`, which vmalert's
`ChannelFailed` reads, and each job's `up` and `scrape_*` (motel reads
`up{job="vmalert"}` to tell vmalert down). The rest would cost disk
and memory with nothing reading it, and a series motel comes to read
later is added to the list then, which breaks nothing
([What the store scrapes](../notify/DESIGN-metrics.md#what-the-store-scrapes)).
Each one's whole page is still there to read live, the store's over
its socket and the other two inside its namespace:

```sh
curl -s --unix-socket /run/motel-metrics/vm.sock http://vm/metrics
ip netns exec motel-metrics curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8880/metrics
ip netns exec motel-metrics curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9093/metrics
```

A box whose store was set up before motel kept only these goes on
keeping every series until root runs `motel monitor setup --metrics`
again (each load warns that `scrape.yml` differs). After that, the
series it no longer keeps age out over the 14 days, and nothing that
reads the store reads them.

### What is firing, with `amtool`

Debian's Alertmanager package includes `amtool`. It speaks TCP only, so
on a box set up with `--metrics` you run it inside the store's
namespace, where Alertmanager itself listens on `127.0.0.1:9093`
(`motel-am-metrics.socket`, beside its unix socket):

```
$ ip netns exec motel-metrics amtool --alertmanager.url=http://127.0.0.1:9093 alert
Alertname        Starts At                Summary                                                                                                   State

```

vmalert answers in the same namespace, and lists the rules it
evaluates:

```sh
ip netns exec motel-metrics curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8880/api/v1/rules
```

There are three groups: `motel-store` (motel's fixed rules),
`motel-channel-failed` and `motel-operator` (your `threshold` and
`disk_fill` rules). A `post_deploy` rule is never listed here: motel
evaluates it, not vmalert. Each `rules` list is empty while there is
nothing to evaluate.

On a box with notifications only, ask the API over its socket:
`curl -s --unix-socket /run/motel-notify/am.sock http://am/api/v2/alerts`.

## Your own alerts: `rule` lines

With `metrics`, the block also takes rules of your own. Each is one of
motel's kinds, and you set only its numbers:

```
monitor {
	channel ops ntfy {secret.NOTIFY_OPS_URL}
	operator ops
	metrics
	rule errors_high threshold 5xx_share > 0.5 for 1m min_requests 3
	rule disk_filling disk_fill within 1h
	rule blog_regressed post_deploy app blog {
		window 4m
		min_requests 10
		max_5xx_share 0.1
		failures 1
	}
}
```

- **`threshold`**: a metric (`5xx_share`, `p50`, `p95`, `request_rate`,
  `cache_hit_share`, `memory_share`, `cpu_cores`), `>` or `<` a value,
  held `for` a time, for every app or for `app <name>`.
- **`disk_fill`**: a filesystem that will be full `within` the time
  given, at the rate it is filling.
- **`post_deploy`**: after each deploy or rollback of the app, the new
  release compared with the one it replaced. It sends
  `post_deploy_regressed` once, and it never rolls back.

The request metrics need `observe <app>` in the app's site, and a rule
on them reads only the apps motel's last push says are observed: an
app whose `observe` line is taken out drops out at the next push, and
every app does while no push reaches the store for over 75 s, so an
alert firing then resolves. That is motel down, or the store refusing
the pushes: `metrics_store_read_only` says so for a read-only store,
and `metrics_store_down` once they have failed for five minutes. The
rule goes to the operator's channels, and to the app's bound channels
when it is about one app. Every parameter and every refusal is in
DESIGN-metrics.md's [Operator rules](../notify/DESIGN-metrics.md#operator-rules).

## Turn it off, and remove it

A reload that takes the block out gives Alertmanager the config that
sends nothing (setup's own), removes the channel URLs motel copied for
it (`/var/lib/motel-notify/url-*`) and retires vmalert's rules. What
Alertmanager still holds then ends with no message, rather than as a
`[RESOLVED]` that did not happen; the journal says
`monitor: no loaded config has the monitor block's channels: Alertmanager was given the config that sends nothing …`.
A restart or a boot into the Caddyfile without the block does the same
(cmd/motel's gate at `motel run`), saying `monitor: this config has no
monitor block with channels: Alertmanager was given the config that
sends nothing …`. As root:

```sh
# 1. Pause the heartbeat's check off the box: from here on the pings stop.
# 2. Take the monitor block out of the Caddyfile (with a box repo: push
#    it without the block and without secrets/_box/), then:
systemctl reload motel
# 3. Stop Alertmanager. A connection to either of its sockets starts it
#    again, so they go in one command; on a box set up with --metrics,
#    vmalert and the socket in the store's namespace with them (that
#    socket's stop alone stops Alertmanager, and Alertmanager's start or
#    vmalert's starts it again):
systemctl disable --now motel-vmalert.service motel-am-metrics.socket motel-am.socket prometheus-alertmanager.service   # --metrics
systemctl disable --now motel-am.socket prometheus-alertmanager.service   # without --metrics
# 4. The rest of the store, if setup --metrics ran:
systemctl disable --now motel-vm.socket victoria-metrics.service motel-metrics-netns.service
systemctl stop motel-vm.service
```

To stop here is to turn it off. The packages stay installed, and so do
the units, the config that sends nothing and the stored numbers. To
turn it back on, put the URLs back (with a box repo,
`git checkout <the commit before step 2's> -- <host>/secrets/_box`;
without one, `_box.env` is still in place) and the block with them,
then run `motel monitor setup [--metrics]` again, which enables
everything again. A push of the block without `secrets/_box/` is
refused, since its channels name secrets the push does not carry.

To remove it, carry on:

```sh
# 5. The packages, and what they keep:
apt purge prometheus-alertmanager victoria-metrics
# 6. What setup wrote, which no package owns:
rm -f /etc/systemd/system/motel-am.socket /etc/systemd/system/motel-metrics-netns.service \
  /etc/systemd/system/motel-vm.socket /etc/systemd/system/motel-vm.service \
  /etc/systemd/system/motel-am-metrics.socket /etc/systemd/system/motel-vmalert.service
rm -rf /etc/systemd/system/prometheus-alertmanager.service.d /etc/systemd/system/victoria-metrics.service.d
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl reset-failed
# 7. motel's state for them:
rm -rf /var/lib/motel-notify /var/lib/motel-metrics /run/motel-notify /run/motel-metrics
# 8. The URLs themselves: delete /etc/motel/secrets/_box.env (with a box
#    repo, the push without secrets/_box/ in step 2 already removed it).
rm -f /etc/motel/secrets/_box.env
# 9. This page's recipes, if you installed them: they fail once there is
#    no block to send to. Take OnFailure=motel-send-failed@%n.service
#    out of each job that has it too.
systemctl disable --now motel-reboot-required.timer
rm -f /etc/systemd/system/motel-reboot-required.timer /etc/systemd/system/motel-reboot-required.service \
  /etc/systemd/system/motel-send-failed@.service
systemctl daemon-reload
```

`apt purge` removes `/var/lib/prometheus`, `/var/lib/victoria-metrics`
(the stored numbers), `/etc/prometheus` and both files in
`/etc/default`. It does not remove what setup wrote: the six units
and the three drop-ins in step 6, and the state in step 7. It also
leaves the `prometheus` and `_victoria-metrics` system users and their
groups, which `userdel prometheus` and `userdel _victoria-metrics`
remove. Purging before steps 3 and 4 leaves five of setup's units
enabled with no package behind them (both of Alertmanager's sockets
and the store's, the namespace and vmalert), and the next connection to
Alertmanager's socket fails it. If you purged first, run the
`systemctl disable --now` lines of steps 3 and 4 anyway. systemctl
names the two packages' units as missing and exits 5, and still stops
and disables the rest. Then do steps 6 and 7.

Going back to a motel release without monitor is in
[Upgrading](upgrading.md), which also takes the `observe` lines out of
the sites: v0.6.1 refuses those too.

## What has been verified where

| What | Where | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Every command and message on this page | motel's metrics e2e box (`make e2e-metrics`'s image), Debian 13, at 01b2fd5, 2026-11-12 | as shown |
| Setup from nothing, with Debian's packages downloaded | the same box, after `apt purge` | as shown |
| The false recovery after the block alone was removed, before the reload gave Alertmanager the config that sends nothing | the same box at 01b2fd5: block out at 17:52:17, `[RESOLVED]` for a firing `disk_low` and `reboot_required` at 17:56:57–17:57:03, the disk still full | what step 2's reload now prevents |
| The block taken out by a reload, a state firing | motel's notify e2e box (`make e2e-notify`, section 14), Debian 13 | the state directory holds the config that sends nothing and no URL file; the alert's end, posted by root at once rather than awaited, reaches no channel |
| `apt purge` with nothing disabled first | the same box. Its `policy-rc.d` refuses the packages' own stop at removal, as Docker images do, so a real box's prerm may stop more | five units left enabled, as above |
| The removal, with Alertmanager stopped before the block went (this page's order before the reload sent nothing), and `apt purge` first, where the packages' own stops run | the same image at c979404 with `policy-rc.d` removed, 2026-11-12 | steps 2 to 9 leave nothing but the two system users. Purged first, the same five units stay enabled, both unix sockets fail at their next connection, and steps 2, 4, 6 and 7 clear them |
| Going back to v0.6.1 | the same box, with v0.6.1's arm64 `.deb` | refuses `monitor` and `observe`, and starts once both are out, with `_box.env` still there |
| Real Slack, Discord and ntfy servers | not tried. On hotserve-1, an ntfy topic showed the JSON body as the message | owed (DESIGN-notify.md, "Owed") |
| The heartbeat's pings | the same image at c979404, at the stub receiver | 299 s and 300 s apart undisturbed; 439 s across a restart of motel 140 s after a ping |
| A `--state firing` across a restart of motel | the same image at c979404 | `[RESOLVED]` five minutes after the restart, nothing having resolved it |
| A reboot after going back to v0.6.1 | the same image, the container restarted | the store and vmalert come back, Alertmanager and both its sockets stay down, nothing is sent |
| A reboot with monitor set up | hotserve-1 (Debian 13, at 9228935), three cold boots; again at a8038b4, with Alertmanager's own socket in the store's namespace, 2026-11-13 | the store and its sockets come back. At a8038b4 every unit of the stack is up within about a second of `sysinit.target`, Alertmanager starts once, by its sockets, at motel's first connection, nothing is started by hand and nothing fails; the heartbeat's next ping comes 6 min 50 s after its last before the reboot |
| Setup's output with Alertmanager's socket in the store's namespace (first run, second run, upgrade from the proxy), and step 2's `--metrics` line | the metrics e2e box, 2026-11-12, with the change that replaced the proxy; the upgrade from the proxy again on hotserve-1 at a8038b4, 2026-11-13 | as shown; after step 2, Alertmanager, both its sockets and vmalert stay down for 70 s while the store scrapes 9093 and motel reads `am.sock`. On hotserve-1 the upgrade took 6 s, with the site answering throughout; its cold boot is the row above |
| What the store keeps of its own scrapes, and the store's and vmalert's pages read live | the metrics e2e box at 59df185, 2026-11-13 (metrics 4) | of `victoria-metrics` `up` and `vm_free_disk_space_bytes`, of `vmalert` `up`, of `alertmanager` `up` and `alertmanager_notifications_failed_total`, each with `scrape_*`; Alertmanager's page is the store's scrape of it |
