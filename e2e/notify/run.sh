# The notify suite (make e2e-notify), run inside e2e-notify-box as root.
#
# The box is e2e-motel's image with Debian's prometheus-alertmanager
# installed and masked; motel runs the monitor block in
# e2e/notify/Caddyfile, whose channels are paths on e2e-sink, a stub
# that logs every delivery with its time (e2e/notify/sink.py). The suite
# runs `motel monitor setup`, then reproduces the timeline measured on
# hotserve-1 against the corrected route tree
# (research: alertmanager_edge_tests.md, its addendum), through motel:
#
#   Watchdog                      → /deadman, at once
#   deploy_failed (a real deploy) → /ops and /blog, the same second
#   a box one-shot (monitor send) → /ops only, at once
#   four distinct one-shots       → four deliveries, none lost
#   watchdog_throttled blog       → nothing: inhibited by deploy_in_progress
#   watchdog_throttled shop       → /ops, after the 30 s group_wait
#   a box state (monitor send)    → /ops at +30 s; its recovery within a minute of motel's hold
#   oncall (answers 400)          → ChannelFailed to /ops, naming oncall
#   blog-deployer failing         → ChannelFailed to /ops (json beside its ntfy), naming it alone
#   oncall the only operator      → the heartbeat held after 5 m, resumed by a delivery
#
# and the socket's reach: no TCP listener, root and motel admitted,
# nobody refused, nothing of it in an app's sandbox view; the journal
# lines; no channel URL in any journal, the rendered config or
# Alertmanager's API.
