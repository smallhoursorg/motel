// Command motel is the smallhours app server: Caddy with
// zero-downtime app deploys (liveswap), rate-limit hint enforcement
// (penaltybox), the config channel (box, being built: see
// box/DESIGN-box.md), notify (who motel tells, through Alertmanager:
// notify/DESIGN-notify.md) and HTTP caching (Souin + Otter storage)
// compiled in.
// It is distributed as its own binary and OS packages — see the repo
// README — and behaves exactly like a custom Caddy build: same CLI,
// same Caddyfile, same admin API.
