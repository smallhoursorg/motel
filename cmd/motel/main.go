const longDescription = `motel is the smallhours app server: Caddy with zero-downtime app
deploys (liveswap), rate-limit hint enforcement (penaltybox), the box's
config channel, monitor (who motel tells, and the numbers) and HTTP
caching compiled in. Its commands, Caddyfile and admin API are Caddy's,
under the name motel.

On a box, motel runs as motel.service from /etc/motel/Caddyfile. After
an edit there:

	motel validate --config /etc/motel/Caddyfile
	systemctl reload motel

motel's own commands are listed below beside Caddy's; the motel
repository's README and docs/ describe them.
`

func main() {
	// Before Caddy's own validate and reload, whether a backup run would
	// see what the Caddyfile declares (backupcheck.go). Caddy's commands
	// cannot be registered twice, so this comes first.
	stop, args := gateArgs(os.Args[1:], os.Stderr)
	if stop {
		os.Exit(1)
	}
	os.Args = append(os.Args[:1], args...)
	// Provisioning cannot tell `motel validate` from a load; notify's
	// refusals of the box's secrets differ between the two
	// (notify/DESIGN-notify.md, "Secrets at load").
	if len(os.Args) > 1 {
		notify.SetCommand(os.Args[1])
	}
	// The binary's name in every usage line Caddy's CLI prints
	// (`motel monitor setup [--metrics]`, not `caddy monitor …`), and
	// motel's own description at the root's help in place of Caddy's,
	// which tells the reader to run `caddy run`. The root's examples are
	// Caddy's, fixed in its command, and still say `caddy`.

	caddy.CustomLongDescription = longDescription
